# Blob with a Wizard Hat
> my entry into the High Seas Jam

### What is this?
This is a 2D fantasy-*ish* movement-*ish* platformer, made in Godot Engine v4.3

All assets are original **EXCEPT FOR:**
 - a 'right click' sprite (`tile_0078.png`) comes from Kenney.nl (CC0)
 - the fonts 'UnifrakturMaguntia' and 'Roboto', both taken from Google Fonts and licensed under the SIL Open Font license and the Apache 2.0 license respectively.
 - other Godot default assets 

All sprites were made in Aseprite and paint.net

 - This Readme: https://github.com/ByzantineProcess/highseas-magic/blob/main/README.md
 - Desktop downloads (Windows + Linux): https://github.com/ByzantineProcess/highseas-magic/releases/tag/v1
 - Web version (generally worse than desktop, Safari not recommended): https://byzantineprocess.github.io/highseas-magic/

## Bugs
 - the web version doesn't upscale correctly like desktop does and I have no idea why, so big resolution screens are better off playing on desktop.
 - lighting system is nonfunctional when played through Safari, this makes some scenes look overexposed and isn't the intended experience. use Chromium-based browsers or Firefox
